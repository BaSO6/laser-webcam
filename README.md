# laser-webcam
This application detects a red laser pointer in real time using OpenCV. It isolates the laser dot in the video feed by color thresholding in the HSV color space, and then uses contour detection to identify the laserâ€™s location on-screen. The application can detect the laser pointer up to a distance of 2 meters with 10 cm tolerance.
